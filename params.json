{"name":"Simple Music Player","tagline":"Next version of simple music player (SimpleMP)","body":"![icon](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/icon/Gramaphone48x48.png) Simple Music Player\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThis is the next version of simple music player ([SimpleMP](http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/))\r\n\r\nSimpleMP or Simple Music Player is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.\r\n\r\nWhy another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.\r\nI used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)\r\nUnfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.\r\n\r\nAfter long time, now it's time to make a new one!\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.\r\n\r\n*Use it with your own risk!*\r\n\r\nFirst simple functions\r\n======================\r\n\r\n+ Plays mp3, ogg, wma and wav files\r\n+ Drag&Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)\r\n+ Drag&Drop files within the playlist\r\n+ Add directories to the medialib (not yet finished)\r\n+ Simple equalizer\r\n+ Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus\r\n\t+ [Space] play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)\r\n\t+ [Enter] play selected files\r\n  + [Del] delete selected files from current playlist\r\n\t+ [j] play next file\r\n\t+ [k] play previuos file\r\n\t+ [s] shuffle mode on / off\r\n\t+ [r] repeat current file on / off\r\n\t+ [m] mute player on / off\r\n\t+ [e] show the equalizer\r\n  + [l] show the medialib\r\n+ flexible, responsive UI (different views for different main window sizes)\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\n\r\nall releases [here](https://github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/releases)  \r\n\r\ndownload latest release v1.9.0.13 [here](https://github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/releases/download/v1.9.0.13/smp_1.9.0.13.zip) as zip  \r\n\r\nScreen shots\r\n============\r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 13](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2014-07-14_22h42_19.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 13](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-11-26_20h58_04.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 12](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-11-26_20h58_17.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 11](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-11-10_23h42_10.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 10](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-11-10_23h42_24.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 09](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-09-16_09h40_08.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 08](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-09-16_09h40_02.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 07](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-02-07_22h49_52.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 06](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2013-01-05_23h26_18.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 05](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2012-12-19_21h55_18.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 04](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2012-12-19_21h54_53.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 03](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2012-12-19_14h48_05.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 02](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2012-12-16_17h14_57.png)  \r\n\r\n![very early screenshot 01](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/screenshots/2012-12-13_23h14_25.png)  \r\n\r\n##License and copyright\r\n\r\nSimple Music Player\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jan Karger\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
