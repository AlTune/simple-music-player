{"name":"Simple Music Player","tagline":"Next version of simple music player (SimpleMP)","body":"![icon](https://raw.github.com/punker76/simple-music-player/master/icon/Gramaphone48x48.png) Simple Music Player\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThis is the next version of simple music player ([SimpleMP](http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/))\r\n\r\n**SimpleMP** or **Simple Music Player** is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.\r\n\r\nWhy another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.\r\nI used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)\r\nUnfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.\r\n\r\nAfter long time, now it's time to make a new one!\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.\r\n\r\n***Use it with your own risk!***\r\n\r\nFirst simple functions\r\n======================\r\n\r\n+ Plays **mp3**, **ogg**, **wma** and **wav** files (should be enough... or not?)\r\n+ Drag&Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)\r\n+ Drag&Drop files within the playlist\r\n+ Add directories to the medialib (not yet finished)\r\n+ Simple equalizer\r\n+ Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus\r\n\t+ **[Space]** play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)\r\n\t+ **[Enter]** play selected files\r\n\t+ **[Del]** delete selected files from current playlist\r\n\t+ **[j]** play next file\r\n\t+ **[k]** play previuos file\r\n\t+ **[s]** shuffle mode on / off\r\n\t+ **[r]** repeat play list on / off\r\n\t+ **[m]** mute player on / off\r\n\t+ **[e]** show the equalizer\r\n\t+ **[l]** show the medialib\r\n+ Flexible, responsive UI (different views for different window sizes)\r\n+ You can link with the supported files (open with...)\r\n+ Working as single instance, that means\r\n\t+ if you try start the player twice you get always the first started player\r\n\t+ if you link with supported media files, the player loads the new files and play the first file from the added files\r\n+ Tooltip on playlist files  \r\n\r\nIdeas?
