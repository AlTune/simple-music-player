        <h1>Simple Music Player</h1>

<p>This is the next version of simple music player (<a href="http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/">SimpleMP</a>)</p>

<p><em>Use it with your own risk!</em></p>

<p>SimpleMP or Simple Music Player is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.</p>

<p>Why another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.
I used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)
Unfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.</p>

<p>After long time, now it's time to make a new one!</p>

<p>It's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.</p>

<h1>First simple functions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop your files or directories into the player (on the play list)</li>
<li>Plays mp3, ogg, wma and wav files</li>
<li>Shortcut keys if the player is on top and has the focus

<ul>
<li>[Space] play or pause current file (if none is playing, the first selected file starts)</li>
<li>[Enter] play selected files</li>
<li>[j] play next file</li>
<li>[k] play previuos file</li>
<li>[s] shuffle mode on / off</li>
<li>[r] repeat current file on / off</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple Equalizer</li>
</ul><h1>Download</h1>
