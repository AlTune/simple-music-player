<p>This is the next version of simple music player (<a href="http://jkarger.de/simple-music-player/">SimpleMP</a>)</p>

<p>SimpleMP or Simple Music Player is a simple and easy to use music player for free. It plays the most common music files (mp3, ogg, wma, wav) in a simple way.</p>

<p>Why another music player? When I decided to make my first player back in 2005, the Winamp 3 player was to buggy and very slow! I stopped developing in 2007.
I used my favorite programming language Delphi 5 and I learned a lot of  new stuff. It was a great time and a few people in the Delphi community honoured my work :-)
Unfortunately, the interface of the FMOD sound library was no longer supported for Delphi and I decided to stop working on it.</p>

<p>After long time, now it's time to make a new one!</p>

<p>It's not perfect and many function not yet implemented.</p>

<p><em>Use it with your own risk!</em></p>
